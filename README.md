# App-Security-Project
This was a group project where the team developed different security features/hardening techniques for a Web Application Programming Interface (API) using Flask. We are required to create two versions of the project. One vulnerable and the other non-vulnerable where we have to fix all he issues in the vulnerable version based on the [OWASP Top 10 API security.](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/)
